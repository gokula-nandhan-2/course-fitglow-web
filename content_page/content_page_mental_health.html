        <h1 class="sub-heading">Introduction of Mental Health</h1>
        <p>Everyone feels worried or anxious or down from time to time. But relatively few people develop a mental illness. What's the difference? A mental illness is a mental health condition that gets in the way of thinking, relating to others, and day-to-day function.</p><br>
            <b><p>What is Mental Health?</p></b><br> 
            <p>Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It influences our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Mental health is crucial at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. <br><br>
            Good mental health allows individuals to realize their full potential, cope with the stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to their communities. Mental health is not merely the absence of mental illness but involves maintaining a state of well-being where individuals can manage daily stress, function effectively, and maintain fulfilling relationships.</p><br>
        <p>
            <b>Common Mental Health Conditions:</b><br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Depression: which may be defined as a long lasting feeling of being sad with no interest in things that used to be enjoyable, may also include changes in appetite and weight, nightmares or insomnia, and possibly feeling empty and useless. It hinders ones activities in daily life and can cause complications in physical well-being.</li><br>
                <li>Anxiety disorders include: GAD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and others. The symptoms include agitation, exhaustion, sweating, difficulty focusing, and (cardiac) palpitations.</li><br>
                <li>Bipolar Disorder: Involves extreme mood swings, including manic (highs) and depressive (lows) episodes. Symptoms during manic phases include elevated mood, increased activity, and risky behaviors, while depressive phases mirror those of depression.</li><br>
                <li>Schizophrenia: A severe mental disorder characterized by distorted thinking, perceptions, emotions, language, sense of self, and behavior. Symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and impaired functioning.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <section id="section-two">
        <h1 class="sub-heading">Maintaining Mental Health</h1>
        <p>Some examples of daily practices for mental well-being such as Mindfulness and Meditation, physical activities and Balanced Diet.</p><br>
        <p>Meditation can help reduce stress and improve focus. Techniques such as guided meditation, breathing exercises, and mindful walking can be incorporated into daily routines. </p><br>
        <p>Frequent exercise reduces the symptoms of anxiety and depression, which has a major positive impact on mental health. Exercises that increase heart rate naturally, such as jogging, yoga, strength training, and walking, generate endorphins.</p><br>            
        <p>An important factor in mental health is nutrition. Eating a diet high in whole grains, lean meats, fruits, and vegetables promotes brain health. Mood swings and energy collapses can be avoided by limiting your use of processed foods, sugar, and caffeine.</p><br>   
        <br><br>
        <p>Stress management techniques, healthy coping mechanisms, and positive relationships are some examples of ways to build resilience.</p><br>
        <p>Techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, and visualisation are all part of effective stress management. These methods lessen the effects of stress by calming the body and mind.</p><br>
        <p>Hobbies, writing, and quality time with loved ones can all help you decompress and cope with your feelings. Creating appropriate coping strategies is essential for handling the difficulties of life.</p><br>
        <p>Having wholesome and encouraging interactions is essential for mental wellness. Good social relationships can boost self-esteem, lessen loneliness, and offer emotional support.</p><br>

    <section id="section-three">
        <h1 class="sub-heading">Seeking Help and Treatment</h1>
        <p>Psychologists, Psychiatrists, Counselors/Therapists and Social Workers, these are the some types of mental health professionals.</p><br><br>
        <p>Psychologists provide therapy and counselling and often focus on behavioural interventions. Psychiatrists are the medical doctors who prescribe medication and provide therapy and social workers provide counselling and connect individuals with resources.</p><br><br>
        <p>Additionally, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focuses on changing negative thought patterns, and Dialectical behavior Therapy (DBT) combines with mindfulness and emotional regulation.</p>
        <p>Now discuss some medications, such as antidepressants, antianxiety medications, and antipsychotics, which are used to manage symptoms.</p><br><br>
        <p>In holistic approaches such as yoga, acupuncture, and herbal supplements and in complementary therapies such as massage therapy and aromatherapy these are the alternative treatments.</p><br><br>
